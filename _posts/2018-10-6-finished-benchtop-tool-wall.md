# Finished the Benchtop Tool Wall

![](/IMG_7871.jpg)

My new benchtop tool wall is "finished"! (That is not to say I won't stop working on it...) The tool wall is basically a frame around some 1/2x1" wire mesh with a shelf on top. The shelf includes some LED tape under it to act as a work light. The mesh is used to hang various tool holders from.

Here's something like the wire mesh I used: https://www.amazon.com/YARDGARD-309301A-gauge-galvanized-welded/dp/B0009EU6BU

So for I have these tool holders:

* Generic "pencil box" (I have three of these so far)
* Magnetic "stip" holder (actually a series of magnets, one for each tool)
* Dental pick holder
* Needle file holder
* Screw driver and hex-bit holder
