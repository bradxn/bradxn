I'm working on yet another box generator. I have several reasons for making a new one, including:

* Many existing box generators make six-sided boxes, but I usually want one that is open at the top.
* Most of them require the use of millimeters, but I'd rather use inches sometimes.
* Most are not WYSIWYG
* I suffer from NIH syndrome
* I want a place to experiment with more options

For now, I have just hacked on another project I found here: https://github.com/bumblebeefr/svg-box-generator. 
The original project had comments in French, which I have translated to English. I've also completely redone
the user interface to include a "preview" panel.

I still have lots of work to do, including:

* Allow imperial units to be used. I expect to allow both decimal and fractional inches as well as millimeters.
* Add an option to indicate if the dimensions are inside or outside. (Possibly per-dimension.)
* Add options to eliminate more sides.
* Add an option to make the front and back walls different heights on an open box.
* Add options to include compartments in the box.
