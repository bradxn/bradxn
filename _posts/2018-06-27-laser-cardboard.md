# Cardboard Box

Cut: 250/90

Engrave: 1000/25

Score: 500/50 -- this is too much!  500/25 worked pretty well - could go a bit higher


Trying some cardboard…  An Arbonne box -- 0.159" thick

Need to export from Affinity Designer at 96dpi (not the default of "document resolution")

500/50 cut through the top and made some pinholes in corners.

Trying 500/80: not quite, more holes though

Trying 350/80: still no

250/80: very close!

250/90: Success!

Trying an engrave: 1000/10 too light…changed to 1000/25
